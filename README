This project implements a simple Lisp interpreter in Haskell. The interpreter
is implemented as a pure function and does not support mutation. Unlike the
Scheme dialect of Lisp the Lisp implemented by this particular interpreter
does not support lexically scoped closures. Instead dynamic scoping is used.

To compile the source code under Linux run the script:

  ./build.sh

When the source code is compiled an executable called "main" is created
in the project's bin directory. This executable should be run directly from
the base directory of the project to ensure that the core libraries written
in Lisp will be loaded correctly. This can be done by running the script:

  ./run.sh

Similarly to compile under Windows the build.bat and run.bat scripts are
provided.

The scripts assume that the ghc (Glasgow Haskell Compiler) is already installed
on the target system and is included in the system path.
